					<h2 class="definition">WHAT IS PHOTOGRAPHY</h2>	
					<p> Photography is often taught within art, craft and design GCSE and A level specifications but many practitioners and historians would dispute its place there, preferring to think of it as a vocational discipline.
					Photography is a multi-disciplinary subject with its origins in science. 
					Photography is bound up in the history of technological innovations, from the invention of the Daguerreotype to the digital revolution. Each new technological breakthrough has shifted the way we see and represent the world photographically.
					Photography is a democratic subject. Almost everyone is able to take a picture these days and the sheer scale of photographic picture-making across the planet is overwhelming. 
					Photography is therefore all around us. Students see numerous photographic images every day, many of which advertise products, services, lifestyles and ideologies. Being aware of the ways in which they are being manipulated, what might be called the visual literacy argument, seems even more important. </p>

					<h2 class="history">HISTORY OF PHOTOGRAPHY</h2>	
					<p>The basic concept of photography has been around since about the 5th-century B.C.E. It wasn't until an Iraqi scientist developed something called the camera obscura in the 11th-century that the art was born.

					Even then, the camera did not actually record images, it simply projected them onto another surface. The images were also upside down though they could be traced to create accurate drawings of real objects such as buildings.

					The first camera obscura used a pinhole in a tent to project an image from outside the tent into the darkened area. It was not until the 17th-century that the camera obscura became small enough to be portable. Basic lenses to focus the light were also introduced around this time.</p>
